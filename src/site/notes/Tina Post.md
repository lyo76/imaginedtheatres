**Tina Post** is a Provost’s Postdoctoral Fellow in the English Department of the University of Chicago, where she teaches courses for Creative Writing, Theatre and Performance Studies, and the Center for Race, Politics, and Culture. She earned her MFA in creative nonfiction from the University of Alaska–Anchorage and her PhD in African American Studies from Yale University. Both her scholarship and artistic works explore the effects of formal or performative decisions in communicating—or in failing to communicate—position, affect, and identity. Tina’s first book project, _Deadpan Aesthetics in Black Expressive Culture_, examines expressionlessness and affective withholding in a range of black cultural and artistic sites. Her scholarly work can be found in _TDR/The Drama Review,_ and is forthcoming in _Modern Drama_ and _Time Signatures_ (Duke University Press). Her creative work has appeared in _The Appendix_ and in _Stone Canoe,_ where it won the S.I. Newhouse School Prize for Nonfiction.
