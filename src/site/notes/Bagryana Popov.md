Dr **Bagryana Popov** is an award-winning theatre artist, lecturer, and researcher who works in an interdisciplinary way. She has collaborated with acclaimed professional theatre and dance artists, students, and communities as director, actor, dramaturg, and performance maker. She is interested in how artistic practice can speak about social and political reality. Her research interests include embodiment, site-specific performance, politics, and the ethics of representation. Much of her work has examined themes of place, displacement, refugee experience, and trauma as a result of war. Her work has been presented around Australia and internationally in Bulgaria, Macedonia, and Finland. Her current ongoing _The Uncle Vanya Project_ is a site-specific, durational version of Chekhov’s early environmentalist play, transposed to the Australian landscape, examining the relationship between performance, place, and the environment. Dr Popov lectures in theatre at La Trobe University, Melbourne.
